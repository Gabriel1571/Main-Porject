    <div>
        <p style="text-align: center;">After the Witch Queen uses her blood to remove the limits on Asta's Anti Magic,
            he learns to channel the energy throughout his body and attains a form where Anti Magic courses through him
            and covers part of his body. To activate the form, Asta must stand still with one of his swords and
            concentrate on circulating the energy, which leaves him open to attack.</p</div>

        <div>
            <p style="text-align: center;">This form is drawn to strong magic and greatly increases his strength and
                speed while granting him the ability to fly. This form also clears his mind of all doubts and extraneous
                thoughts, and improves his focus and clarity of mind. Since the form automatically targets strong magic,
                Asta does not have to consciously react to an attack, but he also has no control over what it targets
                and can be led away from his opponent. Additionally, the physical exhaustion of using the form limits
                Asta's usage to only twice each day, although he can push for a third. </p>
