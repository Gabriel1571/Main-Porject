                    <div><p style="text-align: center;">Jin Mo-Ri uses Renewal Taekwondo, a martial art created and taught to him by his grandfather. All his attacks emphasize speed and power. He only uses his legs when an opponent is deemed worthy otherwise he'll use a combo of punches to beat his opponent. His level is usually 6 but it rises to 13 when he fights seriously using his legs.

                        Jin Mo-Ri survived the effect of the Sage's Pill. Na Bong-Chim believes it is due to Jin being capable of holding more energy than the single pill was able to generate. This is later turned out to be a result of him being an inhabitant of the Sage Realm which the fruit has no detrimental effect on. In the past, Sun Wukong stuff himself with sage pills that only come once every thousand years. After eating sage pills, Jin Mo-Ri learned to remove his limiter and exponentially increasing his power.
                        
                        After entering Lord of the Heavens mode and fully regaining his powers and memories, Jin Mo-Ri has been stated to be on the same level as the First Crown Prince, even eventually defeating him. After the destruction of Oraeguk and his journey through space and the Heavenly Realm, his ability increased substantially as he trained them while he was stranded on the planet that houses The Skyscraper. This was proven later on, when he was able to fight multiple realm masters simultaneously whilst maintaining the upper hand.
                        
                        After his loop of binding was broken by 666:Satan, his base state's physical power increased considerably.
                        
                        Odin, a god known for his wisdom, guessed that Jin Mo-Ri's power comes from his mastery over human, demon, and God skills. His skill is such that The Circle, Master of Seventh Heavenly Realm, provide him with his Core Element, his life and essence, to serve him as its master(Something that didn't happen when 666:Satan defeated The Circle).[2] Odin also stated that the Monkey King's great power, which allowed him to defeat the previous supreme god, Tathagata, comes partially from eating Tang Xuanzang, his master, alive.[1]
                        
                        Superhuman Strength: Jin Mo-Ri has shown strength numerous times throughout the series which exceeds normal human standards and even exceeding Demons or Gods standards various times through many fights.
                        
                        Superhuman Speed: Jin Mo-Ri has demonstrated incredible speed. He is fast enough that characters such as Gang Man-Suk, one of the Three Emperors of Korea, was unable to react, kicking said character 3 times instantly. He was able to react to lightning strikes from Mage.
                        
                        Superhuman Endurance: Jin Mo-Ri has shown an extreme level of superhuman endurance. When fighting against Dae-Wi he survived the Blue Dragon's Storm, remaining conscious even after losing tremendous amounts of blood.
                        
                        Superhuman Durability: Jin Mo-Ri has exhibited an extreme level of durability, which elevated to a monstrous degree after his awakening. He took an attack that nearly cleaved the entire Sage Realm in half, comparable to the size of the Earth. Even without his godly power his durability is monstrous: he was in the centre of the explosion of Oraeguk and survived, being in regular condition some time later.</p</div>

                    <div><p style="text-align: center;">Superhuman Agility: Due to the natural strengthening of his body from training with his grandfather he has supernatural Agility. He is agile enough move any any position as he sees fit. He has shown the ability to effortlessly flip and jump around a fight using most surfaces to his advantage.

                        Adoptive Muscle Memory: He also has the amazing ability to memorize and effectively use new martial arts techniques after having only experienced/see them once in battle. And even more incredibly, he can create entirely original techniques as counters after suffering a technique only once in the very same battle.
                        
                        Analytical Skill: Like Park Il-Pyo, Jin Mo-Ri possess great analytical skills when he devises strategy for weaker members of his team to beat or injure stronger opponents. He can recognize a martial arts weakness or a technique weakness upon witnessing it once and come up with counter strategies.
                        
                        Knowledge of the Human Anatomy: Due to reading the book about the Nabong Needle Ryu Jin Mo-Ri is quite knowledgeable about the human anatomy. This is shown when he can find the weak points on an enemies body,can seal blood flow inside his enemies body for internal attacks, can remove limiters on his body for stats boost or seal his pain receptors.
                        
                        Immortality: The King suspects the Monkey King has this, and Odin implied that Sun Wukong gained it after eating Tang Sanzang's flesh.[3] </p></div>

                        <div><p style="text-align:center;">In his Godly form all of his natural attributes are greatly amplified. The form he took whenever he used his power is called The Monkey King Mode, represented by the Loop of Binding around his head. Initially the headband tightened around his head whenever he used too much power, but now it seems to be no longer a problem.

                            He also wields a consorts of various weapons with different abilities and purpose. In the past The Monkey King was so powerful he was capable of possibly even giving a challenge to the three Heavenly Princes, he was able to kill many gods incredibly easily and even stayed in fire for 49 days after fighting Nine-Tails Guardian. Originally his eyes were blue, sporting black crosses. They appeared to stay that way until he was later captured and imprisoned on the lowest level of the Eight Trigrams Prison. There he spent 49 days in intense flames only to break out, his eyes had changed to red color as his power further increased.</p></div>
                        
                            <div><p style="text-align: center;">Ability Enhancement: All of his abilities as in normal mode increase tremendously whenever he enters The Monkey King Mode.
                                Enhanced Strength: In this mode his strength increased to the point that a single punch can defeat several titans. The clash between him and 666:Satan also destroyed Sky Castle, the base of First Heavenly Realm.
                                
                                Enhanced Durability: This increase his durability as being grabbed by nephilims and thrown planets by The King doesn't leave any damage. He also barehandedly catch Michael's blade without cutting his own hands. Blade of Tathagata and Lightning Blade, however, can wound him.
                                
                                Enhanced Endurance: His already monstrous endurance increase to the point that Limiter Removal 250,000x rebound doesn't make him pass out.
                                
                                Enhanced Speed: His speed increase tremendously as seen by him defeating 400,076,000 Apostles instantaneously while at the same time bisecting Beelzebub.
                                
                                Enhanced Agility: His agility increased to the point that he can easily dodge omnidirectional attacks from 7th Floor Owner.
                                
                                Loop of Binding: His headband limits his power, in exchange, it grant Jin Mo-Ri a certain form of protection. The Monkey King can't remove it on his own. It was cracked and finally destroyed in Jin Mo-Ri's fight against 666:Satan.
                                
                                Fiery Eyes and Golden Pupils: This ability allows him to understand a language he previously had no knowledge of and see much farther than normal humans. Originally he received this ability, as the Monkey King, after being imprisoned in Eight Trigrams Prison, but lost it when he was reduced to form of a baby. After training himself in the Owners of the World's planet, he regained this ability.
                                
                                Shapeshifting: Jin Mo-Ri can, to unknown extent, changes his physical feature. He can regress his age and change his face into another person, becoming Dan Mo-Ri. However, despite this, he can't remove the scars he obtained in battles.
