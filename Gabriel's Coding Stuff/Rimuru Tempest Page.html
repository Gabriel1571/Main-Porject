                        Using Great Sage, he can quickly read a book by copying it completely. Simultaneous utilization of Great Sage and Gluttony allows the high-speed copy and review of the magic books that he holds in his hands. With that, he can postpone checking the content of the book for a later time. Unfortunately, it is not possible to be able to use magic just by copying books. But, taking and copying it, he's able to make the index of the magic books that he wants. After this, it's necessary for him to study them one by one. Taking that into consideration, it can be said that Rimuru holds a great amount of knowledge regarding magic as well as being speculated to be able to use most of the magic in those books, if not all of them.
                        
                        After evolving into a Demon Slime, the ability to freely change between material and spiritual bodies was added. As a result of the evolution, his total magical energy greatly increased. Compared to the original amount, it was ten times as large.
                        
                        He can use skills that don't rely on magical energy such as raising his abilities using fighting spirit technique with Herculean Strength in addition.
                        
                        Thanks to Hakurou's guidance, his skills with the sword was improved.</p></div>
